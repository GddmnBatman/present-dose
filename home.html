<p>This year has been a long year for me. It has been a long year for people I know. I remember earlier at some point this year I was speaking to a friend that I game with. He is a bit younger than me, not even out of high school. He lives in Israel. I have always been up to date on current events but for some reason I never linked him to those events. Maybe it was because we would either be talking about school or gaming. Maybe it was just the fact that whenever we spoke he always seemed calm and like he didn't have any worries. Maybe I just assumed that a child that age had no problems to worry about. One day I saw him online earlier than usual and asked him if he was cutting class. Non chalantly he said "No, there was just a bombing near my school so they sent us all home. We had to walk because it took out some of the roads and the rest were blocked with emergency vehicles.". At that moment I felt really bad for him that he has to go through that at such a young age and felt quite dumb for not making the connection on my own sooner. To all those wondering him and his family are doing quite well.</p>

<p>So should I be thankful? I really should be. Compared to a lot of people I live quite a boring life. My life has never been easy, but I have nothing to complain about. This time last and even after New Years I was unemployed. Since February however I started a job and received multiple raises / promotions. I have a training on December 1st which is part of the final steps to my next promotion which I hope to receive within the next year. The resources I gained from this job helped me to take care of my mom - who is doing as well as can be - and start my own business in April of this year. That business has grown quite a bit to the point where I have employees, contacts with certain companies and options for the future. </p>

<p>The biggest thing I feel thankful for is my friends. I have always kept a small group of friends, but I have never really had a problem with any of them. Most of these people I have known for five to ten years and in that time I have seldomly said thank you. So to those friends I want to say "thanks". Thanks for being a better friend than anyone can ask for. I might not have made this far or this <span id="ita">easily</span> without some of you.</p>

<p>This is also concurently the launch of my personal website where I will eventually add a blog and some cool coding things and other fun stuff that I have been meaning to put up. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:ryan@iambatman.nyc" target="_top">ryan@iambatman.nyc</a></p>
